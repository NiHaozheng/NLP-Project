# Using emoji and emoticon to predict sentiment
Class Project for COMSE6998 (NLP in Context): Computational Models of Social Meaning (Spring 2018)

# Important deadline
* **Project proposal** (3/5/2018 before class; ungraded)
Your Project Proposal should list the people who will carry out the project. It should explain what you propose to do, why it is scientifically interesting, what previous work has been done in the area (a short one paragraph with a list of references you think are relevant to your project), what you plan to accomplish by the end of the project, and how you plan to accomplish this (includes discussion of available data or plans to collect the data). You should also note any obstacles to your plans. (At this stage we will mainly be interested in determining how feasible your project is and how much you have thought about it). The project proposal should be one page long (list of references can be additional page(s)). One project proposal per team.
* **Literature review** (3/26/2018 at 11:59pm; 10%)
The main goal of the literature review will be to place your project idea in the context of existing work. You will select the most relevant prior research on this topic and discuss these papers (substantially more extended than the 2-3 papers you have included in the project proposal). Then you will discuss briefly how your approach/method/problem differ from this existing work. A possible structure of the literature review can be:
1) briefly state the goal of the project
2) briefly state the research hypotheses you will test 
(what question(s) do you want to answer?)
3) briefly state what you plan to do 
4) discuss in detail the previous research on this topic and how it related to 
your planned work. This should be the main part of the document
One literature review write-up per team, but an explicit description of each participant's contribution to the literature review writeup needs to be submitted as well as part of the write-up (you can add it as the last section before references). I expect about 4-6 pages document (+ any number of pages of references)
* **Class presentation** (4/25/2018;4/30/2018; 10%)
* **Final Paper & Project** (5/7/2018 at 11:59pm; 40%).
